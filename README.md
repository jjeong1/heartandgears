Instructions: (using .exe file)

1. Click Start to begin the game.
2. Talk to the fairy NPC by clicking through the dialogue.
The bird “automon” (the enemy) will fly down in front of the players. A glowing blue sphere is located in front of the players. Press on the up arrow key or the Oculus trigger button to simulate an increase in heart rate and synchrony. The blue sphere will grow in size.
3. On defeat, with the appearance of a gear where the bird was, you may exit the game.

Project Objective:
The aim of this project was to create a game that utilizes biosignals from two users in adapting enemies and player attacks in reaction to high emotion and synchrony. The game emphasizes the importance of teamwork and cooperation, and encourages excitement (high energy and positive emotions in regard to the emotional quadrant) with rewards in game. We created a standard rpg game with a detailed storyline where the two players are requested by a friendly NPC to fight an enemy. The players’ attack mechanism is represented by a glowing sphere that grows larger as the players’ heart rates get faster and closer in range (method of computing high energy and synchrony undetermined). This reward in a more “powerful” attack encourages players to continue to be excited and in sync.
